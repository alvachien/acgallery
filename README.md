The web app allows end user uploads the image files to public folder (the private image will be uploaded to Azure Storage account which not implemented in this open-source version yet), and update the records in the database.

The web app also provides the authority control over the album and photos. The identification upon user is hosted on another Azure application ACIdServer.
